# enflo

**A timer app that visualizes your focus through real-time entropy particles.**

Entropy is a measure of disorder; here it represents scattered focus.

Mental entropy (i.e. scattered focus) naturally increases—unless we deliberately lower it through deep immersion. And without feedback, it’s hard to know _when_ you’re truly focused. enflo transforms that invisible process into an interactive particle visualization, guiding you from chaos to clarity.

enflo addresses three core challenges:

- **Lack of feedback**: Traditional timers measure only time, not _quality_ of focus.
- **One-size-fits-all intervals**: Pomodoro timers ignore personal rhythms.
- **Motivation gaps**: Users struggle to maintain momentum without real-time insights.

## Solution Overview

Enflo bridges that gap by:

- **Real-Time Entropy Visualization**: Animated particles represent concentration state (0-1).
- **Personalized Strategies**: Onboarding assessment and rhythm-based recommendations.
- **Real-Time Interventions**: AI-driven tips when attention dips.
- **Flexible Timer**: 5–90 min sessions and auto-extension during deep focus.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Weekly/monthly focus insights and AI-powered recommendations.

## Key Features

1. **Entropy Visualization**
   - Dynamic particle system tied to live entropy score.
   - Interactive touch & drag responses.

2. **Personalization**
   - Rhythm-based session suggestions based on past performance.
   - Collects detailed behavioral signals such as device shaking, app exits, and pause durations.
   - These signals are reflected in the entropy score to measure actual concentration quality.
   - Based on this data, enflo provides real-time, personalized strategies to help users stay in deep focus.

3. **Interventions**
   - Real-time alerts and suggestions to regain focus.
   - AI-driven proactive strategies based on repeating distraction patterns.
   - Preemptive guidance when approaching known low-focus times.

4. **Flexible Timer**
   - Automatic extension during periods of sustained focus.

5. **Performance Analytics**
   - Track total and average focus times.
   - Analyze session success rates and identify concentration drop-off points.
   - Discover your personal "golden hours" for focus through rhythm analysis.
   - Visualize entropy trends and distraction patterns across sessions.
   - Receive AI-driven improvement tips tailored to your behavioral data.
